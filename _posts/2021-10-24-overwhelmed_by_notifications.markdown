I was planning on writing this week about setting up [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) to check for how much of your app is covered by tests. Unfortunately, I found I had a number of [yaks waiting to be shaved](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving). I wanted to use Codecov with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) but to do that, it seems I need an "executor" such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and that requires a shallow (not "steep", as a difficult thing is commonly referred to) [learning curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/) wiki/Learning_curve). In this context, I was delighted to see GitHub notify me about a way to simplify my coding life.

At [https://github.com/watching](https://github.com/watching) there was waiting for me (as it may be for you) a list of repos that warrant, "Overwhelmed by notifications? We've found some repositories that may be causing notifications you don't need." This is from the "Unwatch suggestions" beta from GitHub. I was able to ignore repos I no longer need to keep an eye on, allowing me to experience what [David Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_(author)), author of *Getting Things Done*, calls "Mind like water".

I'll shave yaks in their turn, but for now my GitHub notifications are at [Inbox Zero](https://www.inc.com/nicholas-sonnenberg/why-inbox-zero-is-worth-it-easier-than-you-think.html). Priceless.
