Welcome to my new blog, “The Makefile”! I chose the name for a few reasons. 

The first is that is relates to my current studies (read obsession) in software development. In the words of [Margaret Rouse](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/makefile), “A makefile is used with the UNIX make utility to determine which portions of a program to compile. A makefile is basically a script that guides the make utility to choose the appropriate program files that are to be compiled and linked together.” (Those of us who study Ruby will be familiar with our own version of this, the rakefile). 

More philosophically, it reminds me of the purpose of all the brain-melting study: to make cool stuff! Like a makefile, I'm pulling in the components I'll need. 

In addition, the name reminds me I'm not only making software. With the help of Flatiron School instructors and fellow students I'm making a new me, with new skills both technical and “soft”. I also hope to make exciting and worthwhile projects that will make life better for others. 

The last few years, I'd been thinking about a new line of work to get into. While I've greatly enjoyed the jobs I've held, it seemed to me there was something out there that would be a better fit for my personality and interests. 

I started to get a clue from how coworkers treated me at the hospital where I work. Though my job is primarily concerned with direct patient care, people started bringing me their computer questions, even sometimes calling me a “computer genius,” though I'd had very little formal training. I came to realize I'd developed certain instincts, born of loving a challenge and ever learning more. 

At the same time, I was listening to lots of tech podcasts. The developers seemed to be having such a good time, enjoying creative community and rising to the challenge of unprecedented innovation. One day, a small, delightful thought came to me: Could *I* do that?

I started with some tutorials and found I liked it. Eventually, I summoned the courage to apply to Flatiron and begin my journey in earnest. 

It's an exciting time to enter the field, both in terms of opportunities for personal success and to shape the world around us. I hope you'll check back as I share some of my learning along the way….
